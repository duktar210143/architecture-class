ssd for faster boot and hhd for storing documents and other datas)

shop list (hard sisk from seagate and western digital)
           (ssd from samsung ,toshiba,OCZ,kinston,intel)
---ensure your hard disk is al least 7,200 revolutions per minute(RPM)

SSD you are looking for should be liated with multi level cell(MLC)flsh memory


2.central processing unti
========
cpu is most commonly known as cpu, process 
hundreds and thousands of program each minute.

-if budget is high go for cpu from intel brand
-if budget is minimum go for a amd processor which is slihtly less efficent then intels core
 -sometimes the desciption clock speed is better performance is wrong
-take a look at the recent builds
 ==shop(while shopping for a processor you 'll see  something called L3cache l3 catch mid tier is 4MB 
mid tier and gigher ends model have 6-8 ,B of cache)
